**Biography:**  

I recently graduated from CU Boulder where I completed a BA in Geography. During my degree, I took classes focusing on climate, weather, environmental science, human and bio-geography, math, statistics, GIS, and remote sensing. I'm very interested in using this background within the context of Earth Data Science to help solve difficult problems facing humans, the environment, and ecosystems. Currently, I'm particularly interested in wildfire research, including the Wildland Urban Interface (WUI). During my final semester at CU, I developed an interactive Python tool for mapping WUI using raster data, allowing the the user to input their own mapping parameters. To continue improving my skills in research, data analysis, and coding, I'm excited to be participating in the Earth Data Analytics Graduate Certificate run by the Earth Lab at CU. 
In my free time, I enjoy hiking, swimming, reading, playing piano, and playing board games with friends and family.

Below is an interactive map showing some of the glaciers in Grand Teton National Park. A few years ago, I did a project where I used historical imagery to measure the retreat of these glaciers.
