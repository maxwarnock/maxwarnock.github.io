**Biography:**  

I recently graduated from CU Boulder with a BA in Geography. During my degree, I took classes focusing on climate, weather, environmental science, human and bio-geography, math, statistics, GIS, and remote sensing. I'm very interested in using this background within the context of Earth Data Science to help solve difficult problems facing humans, the environment, and ecosystems. Currently, I'm interested in wildfire research, including the Wildland Urban Interface (WUI). During my final semester at CU, I developed an interactive Python tool for mapping WUI using raster data, allowing the the user to input their own mapping parameters.
In my free time, I enjoy hiking, swimming, reading, playing piano, and playing board games with friends and family, among many other hobbies.

- University of Colorado Boulder, Bachelor of Arts in Geography, and Bachelor of Music, 2020-2025
