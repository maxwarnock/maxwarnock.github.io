**Biography**  

I'm a student in the Earth Data Analytics Graduate Certificate Program at the University of Colorado Boulder's Earth Lab. I recently graduated from CU Boulder with two bachelors degrees in Geography and Music. During my Geography degree, I took classes focusing on GIS, remote sensing, cartography, environmental science, human and bio-geography, math, statistics, climate, and weather. I'm currently looking for research opportunities to potentially pursue graduate school in geography.
