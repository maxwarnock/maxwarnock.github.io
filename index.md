Education:
- University of Colorado Boulder, Bachelor of Arts in Geography, 2020-2025

I recently graduated from CU Boulder where I completed a BA in Geography. During my degree, I took classes focusing on climate, weather, environmental science, human and biogeographies, math, statistics, GIS, and remote sensing. I'm very interested in using this background within the context of Earth data science to help solve difficult problems facing humans and the environment. Currently, I'm particularly interested in wildfire research, including the Wildland Urban Interface (WUI). During my final semester at CU, I developed an interactive Python tool for mapping WUI using raster data. To continue improving my skills in research, data analysis, and coding, I'm currently enrolled in the Earth Data Analytics Graduate Certificate run by the CU Boulder Earth Lab. 
In my free time, I enjoy hiking, swimming, reading, playing piano, and playing board games with friends and family.
