  <p>A few years ago, I worked on a project using satellite imagery to measure the size of glaciers in Grand Teton National Park over time. My findings showed that the glaciers were rapidly losing size over just a 20 year timeframe. This map shows the general location of the some of the glaciers I studied.</p>
